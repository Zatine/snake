# snake

This was one of my first JavaScript projects. We had recently made a "Lights out"-game in school by creating a table and assigning different ID's to all the cells. It was a fun challenge, and I thought it might be possible to create a more advanced game with the same technique. I realized the classic game of Snake would be a good candidate, and probably suit my current skill level at the time.

Looking at it now it's very messy and has some bugs, but it almost works and I was very proud of it at the time. It might be fun to go back someday and rebuild it, quicker and with better techniques, just to see how far I've come since then.
